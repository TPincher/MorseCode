# MorseCode
A Morse Code translator for my _Nology course.

This project is less focused on webpage styling, and more on demonstrating understanding the separation of logic from DOM interaction in the JS, and JEST testing.

It's functional but simple. Future iterations could include an audio component to play converted messages, or a light for hearing-impaired individuals to be able
to see the Morse code message, akin to a naval signal lamp.
